	As of 0.205_000, I adopted a system where odd minor
	releases (0.205, 0.207, etc.) are developer-only releases
	and even-numbered minor releases (0.202, 0.206, etc.) are
	general releases.

0.202.0 Thu Jan 17 17:01:25 EST 2008

        First Alpha Release

0.200.0 Tue Jan 15 19:17:31 EST 2008
        First Candidate for Alpha Release

	The big jump in version numbers is because the earliest releases used a different
	version number format, and are later in ASCII collating sequence.  As of this release,
	the latest version number is after all others in ASCII collating order.
