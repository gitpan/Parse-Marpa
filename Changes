        First in a Series of Developer's Releases
	Please do not use, unless you're developing Marpa.

	As of 0.205_000, I adopted a system where odd minor
	releases (0.205, 0.207, etc.) are developer-only releases
	and even-numbered minor releases (0.202, 0.206, etc.) are
	general releases.

0.202.0 Thu Jan 17

        First Alpha Release

0.200.0 Tue Jan 15
        First Candidate for Alpha Release

	The big jump in version numbers is because the earliest releases used a different
	version number format, and are later in ASCII collating sequence.  As of this release,
	the latest version number is after all others in ASCII collating order.
