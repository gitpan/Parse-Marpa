0.205_nnn Sat Mar 22
    A series of developer's releases.

    As of 0.205_000, I adopted a system where odd minor releases (0.205,
    0.207, etc.) are developer-only releases and even-numbered minor
    releases (0.202, 0.206, etc.) are general releases.

0.202.0 Thu Jan 17
    First Alpha Release

0.200.0 Tue Jan 15
    First Candidate for Alpha Release

    The big jump in version numbers is because the earliest releases used a different
    version number format, and are later in ASCII collating sequence.  As of this release,
    the latest version number is after all others in ASCII collating order.
