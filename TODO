* Change "internal" grammar definition mechanism, so that it allows closures as strings.

* Have string closures run in special per grammar namespace

* Allow closures for terminals

* Have lex_string evaluate in list context, and
  croak if any additional matches

* Allow macros:
     @LHS
     $LHS_REF
     $LHS[n]
     $LHS{NAME}
     $LHS{NAME}[n]
     @RULE
     $RULE_REF
