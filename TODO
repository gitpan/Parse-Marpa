* Change all to require 5.9.5

* Comments in # or #[ form.  (Check latter is really Perl 6.)

* Code blocks in { } or %{ }% (yacc) form

* (Someday) precedence declarations, a la yacc

* Arguments of semantic routines as @_?  (A la Parse::Yapp)
Note that yacc starts counting at 1, and $_[0] is the parser
object in Yapp.

* Look at Yacc macros yyerrok YYERROR YYACCEPT YYABORT YYRECOVERING

* Look at error recovery.   Is anything in Parse::Yapp or yacc useful?

* Add lex unambigious option

* Change "internal" grammar definition mechanism, so that it allows closures as strings.

* Have string closures run in special per grammar namespace

* Allow closures for terminals

* Go to Perl 10 only, used named captures for lexing

* Allow macros:
     @LHS
     $LHS_REF
     $LHS[n]
     $LHS{NAME}
     $LHS{NAME}[n]
     @RULE
     $RULE_REF

* Allow POD
