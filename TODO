* Eliminate "raw canoncial" names -- simply reject anything ending in a
  closing square bracket

* Explicitly setting start symbol -- sort this out.  Set it in internal
  form?  canonical form?

* There needs to be a way of explicitly setting "no value" for the
  default action and the default null value.

* Are null values and the default null value handled right?  They
  should internally be *REFS* to the values, not the values.

* Test these traces, to ensure tracing reform did not break them:
    TRACE_COMPLETIONS TRACE_PRIORITIES

* Test that max_parses is enforced

* Check Parse::Marpa::Parse::new options.  Do defaults from grammar
  work as advertized?

* Ensure Parse::Marpa::Internal::This::grammar set wherever appropriate.

* Check version, semantics in grammar for source grammar itself.

* Test right and left evaluation in rules

* Test proper and perl5 separation

* Speed-up for pre-computing lexables.  Grammar::LEXABLES, etc.

* Test (or remove?) lexing suffixes.

* Allow macros:
     @VALUE
     $VALUE_REF
     $VALUE[n]
     $VALUE{NAME}
     $VALUE{NAME}[n]
     @RULE
     $RULE_REF

* Add locations for earlemes.  Also for rules?  Use in Carp messages.

* Allow alternation?

* Inplace option for grammars?

* Add to test set
   - basic test for all branches of counted rules: matrix is
     keep/no-keep, separated yes/no, right/left,
     0-1, 1-1, 0-2, 0-5, 1-2, 1-5, 0-*, 1-*, 2-*, 5-*
