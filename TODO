* "my" definitions in self.marpa preamble.  Useful?  Try eliminating them.

* Explicitly setting start symbol -- sort this out.  Note in docs that it
  needs to be set in canonical form.

* Semantics are handled in several places, anywhere from when a rule is
  added to when the parse object is created.  Change so that all semantics
  are computed when the parse object is created.

* When a single production can be ambiguous and is broken up by a CHAF
  rewrite, that affects the order of the parses in a way that cannot be
  manipulated via the priorites.  Do something about this.

* There needs to be a way of explicitly setting "no value" for the
  default action and the default null value.

* Test that max_parses is enforced

* Bugs with comments, especially after null productions and before
  action?

* Priorities cannot be set in grammar source files for terminals.  Fix that.

* Check Parse::Marpa::Parse::new options.  Do defaults from grammar
  work as advertized?

* Ensure Parse::Marpa::Internal::This::grammar set wherever appropriate.

* Check version, semantics in grammar for source grammar itself.

* Test right and left evaluation in rules

* Test proper and perl5 separation

* Speed-up for pre-computing lexables.  Grammar::LEXABLES, etc.

* Test (or remove?) lexing suffixes.

* Allow macros:
     @VALUE
     $VALUE_REF
     $VALUE[n]
     $VALUE{NAME}
     $VALUE{NAME}[n]
     @RULE
     $RULE_REF

* Add locations for earlemes.  Also for rules?  Use in Carp messages.

* Allow alternation?

* Inplace option for grammars?

* Add to test set
   - basic test for all branches of counted rules: matrix is
     keep/no-keep, separated yes/no, right/left,
     0-1, 1-1, 0-2, 0-5, 1-2, 1-5, 0-*, 1-*, 2-*, 5-*
