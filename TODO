* Allow closures for terminals

* Comments in # or #[ form.  (Check latter is really Perl 6.)

* Code blocks in { } or %{ }% (yacc) form?

* Change "internal" grammar definition mechanism, so that it allows closures as strings.

* Have string closures run in special per grammar namespace

* Test lexing prefixes, suffixes

* Allow macros:
     @LHS
     $LHS_REF
     $LHS[n]
     $LHS{NAME}
     $LHS{NAME}[n]
     @RULE
     $RULE_REF

* Allow POD

* Add lex unambigious option

* (Someday) precedence declarations, a la yacc

* (Later) Look at Yacc macros yyerrok YYERROR YYACCEPT YYABORT YYRECOVERING

* (Later) Look at error recovery.   Is anything in Parse::Yapp or yacc useful?
