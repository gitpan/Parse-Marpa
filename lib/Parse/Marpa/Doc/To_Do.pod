=head2 Terminal Priorities Cannot Be Set in MDL

Priorities cannot be set in MDL for terminals.
So far there's been no need for this,
and I don't want to invent an artificial test case.
Once there is an application, I will use that as the test case.

Workaround:
Add extra rules with the terminals you want to prioritize on their right hand side,
and assign 
priorities to the rules.

=head2 Others

=over 4

=item * Make code clean under perlcritic.

=item * Better evaluation of sequences -- just push onto an array via
a ref, reversing at the end if necessary.  All that code could use
better comments.

=item * Add a trace_choices option.  There was an option to trace
non-trivial evaluation choices in the old evaluator, and the new trace_iterations
doesn't entirely replace it.

=item * Add a show_derivation option.

=item * Ensure C<Parse::Marpa::Internal::This::grammar> set wherever appropriate.

=item * Add option for left-to-right evaluation of rules

=item * Test proper and perl5 separation

=item * Parse bocage creation can probably be made a bit slightly cleaner.
At least I think so, based on which I found revising that part of the
Internals doc.

=item * Add a SYNOPSIS to the Plumbing document.

=item * Add to test set: Basic tests of sequences.
The matrix is separation (none/perl5/proper)
and minimium count (0 or 1).
Eliminate keep vs. no-keep, right vs. left.

=head2 Lifting Restrictions on Sequence Productions

The restriction of sequences to sequence productions and of
sequence productions to a single sequence
is not the result of any limit of the Marpa parse engine.
It would not be hard to allow any number of
sequences and optional sequences on the right hand
side of any BNF production.
I'm open to revisiting this issue and lifting the restriction.

The problem is figuring out how to conveniently specify their semantics.
As the right hand side of a production grows more complex,
the semantics becomes
more complex to write, more bug-prone, and harder to debug.

=head2 Other things

=over 4

=item * Test lexing suffixes?  Remove them?

=item * Allow alternation?

=item * Downgrade version conflict or semantics mismatch to warning?

=item * Are there any Parse::Marpa::Read_Only variables?  Eliminate
the namespace, and all the references to it in the documentation?

=item * Add C<{}> and C<[]> syntax to MDL production statements.

=item * Speed-up for pre-computing lexables.  Grammar::LEXABLES, etc.

=item * C<show_tree> before first call to C<value>?  Should
it cause an error message?  How about after unsuccessful
call to C<value>?

=item * Do I need Parse::Marpa::show_value?  Won't Dumper do fine?
