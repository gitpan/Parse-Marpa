=head1 NAME

Parse::Marpa::Doc::To_Do - Marpa's To Do List

=head1 HIGH PRIORITY

=head2 Terminal Priorities Cannot Be Set in MDL

Priorities cannot be set in MDL for terminals.
Fix this before going beta.

Workaround:
Add extra rules with the terminals you want to prioritize on their right hand side,
and assign 
priorities to the rules.

=head2 Describe ambiguous transitions in Internals doc

Add a graf about ambiguous transitions in the Internals document.

=head2 A More Exhaustive Test Suite

Testing has been intensive, but not exhaustive.
The recognition engine has been very well exercised, but many combinations
of options and features have yet to be tried.
To get an idea for what's been well tested,
look in the C<t> (test)
and C<example> (example)
directories of the distribution.
Any feature not tested there can be assumed
to have been only lightly exercized.

=head1 LOWER PRIORITY

=over 4

=item * Should C<Parse::Marpa::Grammar::new> options be defaults or
overrides? -- that is they should take effect before the MDL script
or after.

=item * Finalize semantics later, when evaluator is created.

=item * Allow multiple evaluators for each recognizer, or at least create a method
to safely deep copy recognizers.

=item * If recognizer did not recognize the input, don't allow evaluator to be created.

=item * Add C<{}> and C<[]> syntax to MDL production statements.

=item * Ensure C<Parse::Marpa::Internal::This::grammar> set wherever appropriate.

=item * Combine trace_iteration_search and
trace_iteration_changes into
trace_iterations

=item * Test right and left evaluation in rules

=item * Test proper and perl5 separation

=item * Speed-up for pre-computing lexables.  Grammar::LEXABLES, etc.

=item * Add a SYNOPSIS to the Plumbing document.

=item * Test (or remove?) lexing suffixes.

=item * Allow alternation?

=item * Add to test set: A basic test for all branches of counted rules.
The matrix is keep vs. no-keep; separated yes vs. no; right vs. left;
and 0-1, 1-1, 0-2, 0-5, 1-2, 1-5, 0-*, 1-*, 2-*, versus 5-*.

=item * Downgrade version conflict or semantics mismatch to warning?
