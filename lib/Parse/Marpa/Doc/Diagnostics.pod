Parse::Marpa::Doc::Diagnostics - Marpa's Diagnostics

=head1 OVERVIEW

This document covers Marpa methods and method options primarily useful
for debugging grammars and parses.
With each trace
and each diagnostic method there is often an indication of the degree of
knowledge of Marpa's internal workings needed to use the output.
There's a guide to Marpa internals in the
L<internals document|Parse::Marpa::Doc::Internals>.

=head1 HINTS

In debugging a grammar,
the place where the parse was exhausted
and an inspection of the input and the grammar
often offers enough to spot the problem.

If you don't already have Marpa's C<warnings> option turned on (they're on by default),
you probably should.

If that doesn't help, the next thing I turn on is usually C<trace_lex>.
This tells you which tokens the lexer is looking for and which ones it thinks it found.
If the problem is in lexing, C<trace_lex> tells you the whole story.
Even if the problem is in the grammar,
because Marpa uses predictive lexing
(in other words, because Marpa uses the grammar to predict what terminals to look for next),
which tokens the lexer is looking for is a clue to what the recognizer is doing.

If you run the C<show()> method on the parse object after
the parse is done (that is, after C<initial()> or C<next()>),
it shows the parse derivation in a more or less conventional format.
Next to each rule is the SDFA state involved,
and this is a first glimpse into the internals.

Before going deep into the internals,
you should look at the output of
C<show_rules()> and C<show_symbols()> to see if anything is
clearly not right or not what you expected.
Depending on where in the process you're having problems, you might want to
turn on some of the more helpful traces.
C<trace_actions> will show you the actions as they are being finalized.
In an ambiguous parse,
C<trace_evaluation_choices> shows the choices Marpa is making.
C<trace_iteration_changes> and C<trace_rules> traces the initialization of, and changes in, node values.

For the real "into the Earley sets with gun and camera" stuff,
run C<show_SDFA()> on the grammar and C<show_status()> on the parse object.
The L<internals document|Parse::Marpa::Doc::Internals>
has example outputs from these methods and outlines how to read them.

=head1 DIAGNOSTIC OPTIONS

These are options to the
C<Parse::Marpa::new()>,
C<Parse::Marpa::set()>,
and C<Parse::Marpa::Recognizer::new()>
methods.
All trace output goes to the trace file handle.

=over 4

=item academic

The academic option turns off all grammar rewriting.
This makes the resulting grammar useless for an actual parse.
The purpose is to see if Marpa can 
accurately duplicate examples from textbooks.
This is handy for testing Marpa's deepest internals.

=item trace_actions

Traces the actions as they are finalized.
Little or no knowledge of Marpa internals required.

=item trace_completions

Traces each Earley set as it is completed.
I find it better to wait until parse evaluation time,
when there's more information
and then use C<Parse::Marpa::Recognizer::show_status()>.
Requires knowledge of Marpa internals.

=item trace_evaluation_choices

This option traces the choices Marpa make.
when Marpa has a choice among more than one rule, link or token.
Choices only occur if the grammar is ambiguous.
Knowledge of Marpa internals probably needed.

=item trace_iteration_changes

Traces setting of, and changes in node values.
Knowledge of Marpa internals very useful.

=item trace_iteration_searches

Traces Marpa's exploration of the Earley sets as it is evaluating nodes.
Requires knowledge of Marpa internals.
Probably not useful except in combination with C<trace_iteration_changes>.
C<trace_iterations> turns on both.

=item trace_iterations

A short hand for setting both 
C<trace_iteration_changes> and
C<trace_iteration_searches>.

=item trace_lex

A short hand for setting both 
C<trace_lex_matches> and
C<trace_lex_tries>.
Very useful, and can be interpreted with limited knowledge of Marpa internals.
Because Marpa uses predictive lexing,
this can give you an idea of how lexing is working,
but also of what the parse engine is looking for.
Often the first thing I turn on when I'm debugging a grammar.

=item trace_lex_matches

Traces every successful match in lexing.
Can be interpreted with little knowledge of Marpa internals.

=item trace_lex_tries

Traces every attempted match in lexing.
Can be interpreted with little knowledge of Marpa internals.
Usually not useful without C<trace_lex_matches>.
C<trace_lex> turns on both.

=item trace_priorities

Traces the priority setting of each SDFA state.
Requires knowledge of Marpa internals.

=item trace_rules

Traces rules as they are added to the grammar.
Useful, but you may prefer the C<show_rules()> method.
Doesn't require knowledge of Marpa internals.

Remember, if you are adding rules via the C<source> method option,
the other method options take effect B<after> the processing of the 
C<source> option.
As a practical matter, that means that if you must
don't set C<trace_rules> in a method call prior to the one with the C<source> option,
you will miss the addition of all but a few internally added rules.

=item trace_values

As each node value is set, prints a trace of the rule and the value.
Very helpful and does not require knowledge of Marpa internals.

=head1 DIAGNOSTIC METHODS FOR GRAMMAR OBJECTS

=over 4

=item Parse::Marpa::inaccessible_symbols(I<grammar>)

Given a precomputed grammar, returns the
raw interface names of the
inaccessible symbols.
The same information is more easily obtained by
turning on the warnings option.

=item Parse::Marpa::show_NFA(I<grammar>)

Given a grammar object,
returns a multi-line string listing the states of the NFA
with the LR(0) items and transitions for each.
Not really helpful for debugging grammars
and requires very deep knowledge of Marpa internals.

=item Parse::Marpa::show_SDFA(I<grammar>)

Given a gramar object,
returns a multi-line string listing the states of the SDFA
with the LR(0) items, NFA states, and transitions for each.
Very useful, but requires knowledge of Marpa internals.

=item Parse::Marpa::show_accessible_symbols(I<grammar>)

Given a grammar object,
returns a one-line string with the raw interface names
of the accessible symbols of the grammar,
space-separated.
Handy for quick comparison tests,
but otherwise not very useful.

=item Parse::Marpa::show_location(I<message>, I<text>, I<offset>)

I<message> must be a string,
I<text> a B<reference> to a string,
and I<offset>, a character offset within that string.
C<show_location()> returns a multi-line string with a header
line containing I<message>,
the line from I<text> containing I<offset>,
and a "pointer" line.
The pointer line uses the
ASCII "caret" symbol to point to the exact offset.

=item Parse::Marpa::show_nullable_symbols(I<grammar>)

Given a grammar object,
returns a one-line string with the raw interface names
of the nullable symbols of the grammar,
space-separated.
The format is handy for quick comparison tests,
but otherwise not very useful.

=item Parse::Marpa::show_nulling_symbols(I<grammar>)

Given a grammar object,
returns a one-line string with the raw interface names
of the nulling symbols of the grammar,
space-separated.
The format is handy for quick comparison tests,
but otherwise not very useful.

=item Parse::Marpa::show_problems(I<grammar>)

Returns a string describing the problems a grammar had in the precomputation phase.
Marpa does not immediately throw an exception for many of the
precomputation problems because the user
usually will want to fix several at a time.
If there were no problems, returns a string saying so.

This returned string is the same that Marpa includes
in
exceptions thrown when the user attempts to compile,
or to create a parse from,
a grammar with problems.

=item Parse::Marpa::show_productive_symbols(I<grammar>)

Given a grammar object,
returns a one-line string with the raw interface names
of the productive symbols of the grammar,
space-separated.
The format is handy for quick comparison tests,
but otherwise not very useful.

=item Parse::Marpa::show_rules(I<grammar>)

Returns a string listing the rules, each commented as to whether it
was nullable, nulling, unproductive, inaccessible, empty or not useful.
If a rule had a non-zero priority, that is also shown.
Often useful and much of the information requires no knowledge of
the Marpa internals to interpret.

=item Parse::Marpa::show_symbols(I<grammar>)

Returns a string listing the symbols, along with whether they were
nulling, nullable, unproductive or inaccessible.
Also shown is a list of rules with that symbol on the left hand side,
and a list of rules which have that symbol anywhere on the right hand side.
Often useful and much of the information requires no knowledge of
the Marpa internals to interpret.

=item Parse::Marpa::unproductive_symbols(I<grammar>)

Given a precomputed grammar, returns the
raw interface names of the
unproductive symbols.
The same information is more easily obtained by
turning on the warnings option.

=head1 DIAGNOSTIC METHODS FOR PARSE OBJECTS

=over 4

=item Parse::Marpa::Recognizer::show(I<parse>)

Takes a parse object as its argument and "shows the parse,"
that is,
shows the derivation of the last parse made from a parse object.
Very useful.  Basic use requires no Marpa internals.
It also reports the Earley item and SDFA state at each line of the derivation.

=item Parse::Marpa::Recognizer::show_status(I<parse>)

This is the central tool for debugging a parse
using Marpa internals.
Takes a parse object as its argument and
returns a multi-line string
listing every Earley item in every Earley sets.
For each Earley item,
any current successor, predecessor, effect, cause, pointer or value is shown.
Also shown are lists of all the links and rules in each Earley item,
indicating which link or rule is the current choice.

For detailed investigation of a parse, this, the output of C<trace_lex>
and listings of the symbols, the rules,
and the SDFA states (see C<show_SDFA()>),
will usually be everything you need.
