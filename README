Parse::Marpa

WARNING -- THIS IS A DEVELOPER'S RELEASE, NOT FOR USE BY NON-DEVELOPERS.
I use these releases to avail myself of the cpantesters results,
and to test the release process itself.

Of course, it's open source, and you're entitled to appoint yourself
a developer if you insist on it.  But that will usually not be a
reasonable thing to do.

THIS IS AN ALPHA RELEASE.

It's intended to let people look Marpa over and try it out.  Uses
beyond that are risky.  While Marpa is in alpha, you don't want to
use it for anything mission-critical or with a serious deadline.
I've no personal experience with them, but Parse::Yapp and
Parse::RecDescent are alternatives to this module which are well
reviewed and more mature and stable.
