Parse::Marpa

Marpa generates parses from any BNF grammar.  That includes recursive
grammars, ambiguous grammars, infinitely ambiguous grammars and
grammars with useless or empty productions.  If you can write it in
BNF, Marpa parses it.

THIS IS AN ALPHA RELEASE.

It's intended to let people look Marpa over and try it out.  Uses
beyond that are risky.  While Marpa is in alpha, you don't want to
use it for anything mission-critical or with a serious deadline.
I've no personal experience with them, but Parse::Yapp and
Parse::RecDescent are alternatives to this module which are well
reviewed and more mature and stable.
